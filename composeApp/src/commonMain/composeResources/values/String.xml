I've built mobile and multimedia solutions for companies across industries—ranging from streaming platforms to real-time communication apps—with a strong focus on performance, scalability, and intuitive user experiences.

Currently, I work as a Senior Android Developer at PlanetCast Media Services, where I lead the development of OTT and live-streaming apps used by thousands of viewers, ensuring smooth playback, offline capabilities, and seamless integration with complex backend systems.

Previously, I was an Android Developer at NSG Systems, where I worked on a diverse range of apps—from on-demand cab booking platforms to photo editing tools enhanced with AI—serving both enterprise and consumer users.

Before that, I contributed as a full-stack developer across various freelance and contract roles, building end-to-end applications using modern Android stacks, Firebase, and FFmpeg for media processing.

My work spans crafting reliable ExoPlayer integrations, building custom playback experiences, and ensuring app stability across Android TV, mobile, and Fire TV platforms.
